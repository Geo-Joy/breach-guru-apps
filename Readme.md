To help me provide faster and more accurate assistance with your Next.js apps in the future, you could provide this key context:

Project structure:

Copy/apps/[ComponentName].js - Where actual app components live
/pages/apps/[appName].js - Dynamic routing

Styling context:

Using Tailwind CSS
Primary color class: bg-primary
Layout follows container/responsive pattern
Components need client-side rendering ('use client')

Key technical requirements:

Components must be PascalCase in apps directory (e.g., SipSwpCalculator.js)
URL paths are kebab-case (e.g., sip-swp-calculator)
All apps must be client-side rendered with ssr: false
Using dynamic imports via next/dynamic

Available dependencies from package.json (the key ones you just showed):

jsonCopy{
"dependencies": {
"lucide-react": "^0.263.1",
"react": "^18.3.1",
"react-dom": "^18.3.1",
"react-icons": "^5.2.1",
"recharts": "^2.12.7"
}
}
