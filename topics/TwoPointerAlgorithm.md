# Two Pointer Algorithm

The Two Pointer technique is an efficient method used in algorithms to solve problems that involve searching, comparing, or manipulating elements in arrays or linked lists.

## How it works

1. Initialize two pointers, typically at the beginning, end, or both ends of the data structure.
2. Move the pointers based on certain conditions.
3. Solve the problem in a single pass through the data.

## Benefits

- Often reduces time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
- Useful for problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists.
